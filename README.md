# Control-System-Plots---MATLAB

Abstract:
This project focuses on the frequency and stability analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using MATLAB. It demonstrates the generation and interpretation of Nyquist, Bode, and Root Locus plots for various transfer functions. The work involves defining system transfer functions with specific numerator and denominator coefficients, visualizing their frequency responses, and analyzing system stability characteristics.

The first code segment computes and plots the Bode response of a second-order system using the logarithmic frequency range to evaluate magnitude and phase variations with respect to frequency. The second code constructs the Root Locus plot to study the system’s pole-zero movement and damping characteristics, aided by the use of sgrid for a specified damping factor. The third code generates the Nyquist plot to analyze the system’s stability margins based on open-loop frequency response.

Overall, the project illustrates how graphical techniques like Bode, Root Locus, and Nyquist plots serve as essential tools for understanding system dynamics and designing stable control systems.
